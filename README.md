# 🖥️ Compute Shader Learning Hub

A personal repository for **learning, experimenting, and documenting** everything related to **compute shaders** — from beginner concepts to advanced GPU parallelism.

## 📚 Purpose

This repo serves as my **learning log** for compute shaders.  
It contains:
- Example compute shader scripts.
- Notes and explanations of concepts.
- Experiment results and performance tests.
- Useful resources, links, and references.

## 🚀 What is a Compute Shader?

A **compute shader** is a GPU program designed for **general-purpose parallel computation**.  
Unlike vertex/fragment shaders (which render pixels), compute shaders are free-form and can:
- Process data in parallel.
- Perform physics simulations.
- Generate procedural textures.
- Run complex algorithms faster than on CPU.
